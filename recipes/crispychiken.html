    <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
        <div class="title"><p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!    </p>
        <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.</p></div>
    <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <ul class="ul">
    <li><strong>Chicken</strong>
    <p>Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>
        <p>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Flour</strong>
    <p>All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>
    <p>This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Oil</strong>
    <p>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</p></li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <ol class="ul">
            <li><strong>Make the Breading</strong>
            <p>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>Dredge the Chicken</strong>
            <p>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk.</p><p>Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover.</p><p>Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>Fry the Chicken</strong>
            <p>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and cook for about 30 minutes.</p><p> Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.</p></li>
